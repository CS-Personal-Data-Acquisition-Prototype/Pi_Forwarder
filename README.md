# Pi_Forwarder
A Rust crate for forwarding low-latency sensor data to locally connected clients along with an internal SQLite database used for batching the data to a remote server for long-term storage.

## Features
- Functions with recording rates of 100+ Hz
- Zero-copy data handling
- Parallel client broadcasting
- Low-latency websocket client connections
- Batched database synchonization
- Deletes local data on synchonization confirmation by utilizing transactions

## Overview
Pi_Forwarder recieves serial or networked sensor data; immediately forwarding that data by utilizing the rayon crate for parallelization, the Rust Bytes struct to allow each rayon thread to clone a reference to the underlying memory rather than the memory itself, along with low-latency websockets for real-time delivery to any connected clients; it then inserts the data into an internal SQLite database, which is periodically pulled from to batch transmit to a remote server via TCP.

## Setup
1. Open a terminal on the Raspberry Pi where the repository will be cloned

2. Install the Rust toolchain if not already installed
   - run the command
      ```bash
      curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
      ```
   - Hit enter again for the default installation
   - Check it was installed correctly by running the following commands
      ```bash
      rustc --version
      cargo --version
      ```

2. Clone the repository by running the following command
   ```git
      git clone https://github.com/CS-Personal-Data-Acquisition-Prototype/Pi_Forwarder.git
   ```

3. Add the configuration file `config.toml` in `src` directory
   - Follow the [Configuration](#configuration) section for format guidelines

4. Run the program by running the following command
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

## Configuration
The `config.toml` file contains the following headers and default values

```toml
[debug]
interval = 3_000                             # number of cycles to collect data before printing, when not running in release

[addrs]
local = "0.0.0.0:8080"                       # address to start local websocket server to listen for connections on
remote = "XX.X.X.XXX:7878"                   # address to send TCP batches to, with remote IP replacing the X
endpoint = "/sessions-sensors-data/batch"    # specific endpoint to send TCP batch requests to
# Serial port, baud rates, names, and size of data per read in bytes of desired sensors
sensors = [["/dev/ttyACM0", 250000, "Force", 12], ["/dev/ttyACM2", 115200, "Potentiometers", 12], ["/dev/ttyUSB0", 115200, "9DOF", 12]] #["/dev/ttyACM1", 115200, "GPS", 12]

[database]
file = "data_acquisition.db"                 # name of local database file

[batch]
interval = 10                                # time, in seconds, to wait between batches
count = 10_000                               # max number of rows to send in a single TCP batch

```
